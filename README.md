## Stakeholders

### Interview with [Name Here]
#### Goals
- Want movie rating app with social media aspect.
- Want to easily find information about a movie including director, studio, cast.
- Want something that can take current ratings of movies and offer recommendatings based on what the user likes.
- Its hard to remember all the movies you want to watch so a Watchlist would be helpful.
#### Frustrations
- Can't easily see and show friends movie ratings and reviews and want an easier way to be able to share thoughts.
- Lots of websites with information don't give spoiler warnings and its really frustrating to have something ruined before you watch it.  Definitely have spoiler alert warnings.
- Hard to rank movies against each other and want an easy to do so.
- Current solutions aren't extensive enough and want a better way to interact with a community about movies.

## Product Vision Statement

We aim to make an application where users can record their rating of movies. Their ratings of each movie will be put into a list with other movies they have rated. Friends can view user's activity and the user has a feed where they can view their friends activity. There is also a search feature where users can search for movies or other members. They will be able to see other users ratings of movies.
