## Stakeholders

### Interview with Jacob Chen and Ed Hou
#### Goals
- Want movie rating app with social media aspect.
- Want to easily find information about a movie including director, studio, cast.
- Want something that can take current ratings of movies and offer recommendatings based on what the user likes.
- Its hard to remember all the movies you want to watch so a Watchlist would be helpful.
#### Frustrations
- Can't easily see and show friends movie ratings and reviews and want an easier way to be able to share thoughts.
- Lots of websites with information don't give spoiler warnings and its really frustrating to have something ruined before you watch it.  Definitely have spoiler alert warnings.
- Hard to rank movies against each other and want an easy to do so.
- Current solutions aren't extensive enough and want a better way to interact with a community about movies.

## Product Vision Statement

We aim to essentially make a social media application for movies; users can gather their ratings and thoughts of movies into a list, explore their top genres and get recommendations, and also see other people's activity and their thoughts on certain movies.

## User Requirements

- As a movie critic, I want to be able to write comments about movies so that I can share my thoughts with the public. 
- As a director, I watch a lot of movies so I want a place to keep track of all my ratings so I can remember the best movies for inspiration.
- As a fan of a show, I want to see what other people rate that show so I can better understand how well liked the show is by the public. 
- As a fan of a genre, I want to be able to see the top movies in that genre ranked, so that I know some recommendations for later.
- As a fan of older movies, I want to be able to sort movies by recency, so that I can find older movies that I think I will enjoy more.
- As a parent, I want to keep a list of movie ratings so that I can get a better idea of what movies my kids like.
- As a person's friend, I want to be able to see my friends' thoughts and opinions on certain movies so that I can judge whether or not to watch it myself.
- As a person's friend, I want to be able to see my friends' top genres and get suggestions so that I can find movies to watch together that we will both enjoy.
- As a person's friend, I want to be able to see a list of compability between my movie taste and theirs, so that I can figure out who's movie taste is most similar to mine.
