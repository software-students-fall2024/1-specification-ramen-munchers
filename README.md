    We aim to make an application where users can record their rating of movies.  Their ratings of each movie will be put into a list with other movies they have rated.  Friends can view user's activity and the user has a feed where they can view their friends activity.  There is also a search feature where users can search for movies or other members.  They will be able to see Other users ratings of movies.
